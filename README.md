I am currently submitting proposals on Upwork to find work opportunities. 
However, I have not been successful in securing any projects yet. 

I am currently working on creating proposals based on the projects that are available on the platform. 
At the moment, I am facing a challenge where I need to build an HTML and CSS project from a provided screenshot.

The provided screenshot is in the folder recourses/images/screenshot proposal

Best regards,
Charlie
